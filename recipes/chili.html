    <h1>World's Best Chili!</h1>
    <img src="../images/chili.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There’s just something about a slow-simmered chili on a Sunday that’s chock-full of cozy goodness.Easy ingredients, the perfect balance of flavors, and all ready to simmer away.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ground beef</li>
        <li>bacon</li>
        <li>Jalepeno Peppers, garlic, and onion</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>crushed tomatoes and tomate paste</li>
        <li>Beans (black beans and pinto beans are great, or you can also add kidney beans)</li>
        <li>Broth</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Very important step here – make an extra slice of bacon to crisp up and munch on while the rest of the chili cooks. This is essential.</li>
        <li>Save that bacon grease in the pan and plop your chopped veggies right in there. Your onions, your garlic, your carrots, your jalapeño – all of that goes in the pot. Also, hot tip alert. Take a look at all the ways to cut an onion (without crying).</li>
        <li>Cook The Beef with Your Spices</li>
        <li>Add Beans and Liquid: Toss in the tomato paste, tomatoes, beans, broth, and crispy bacon bits (you know, the ones you have left at least after snacking).</li>
        <li>Let it Simmer: Give things a stir, cover the pot, turn the heat down to a low simmer, and go grab a magazine and a glass of wine. Or maybe more realistically in your household, unload the school backpacks, fold the laundry, and listen to the dog bark at a random squirrel in the yard because dinner is pretty much cooking itself at this point.
        </li>
    </ol>
